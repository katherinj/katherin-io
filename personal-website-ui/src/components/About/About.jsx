                    I participated in a 12-week immersive program at the Netflix
                    Pathways Bootcamp, focusing on advanced back-end development
                    skills and Java concepts. During the bootcamp, I gained
                    hands-on experience creating efficient Java applications and
                    microservices, using tools such as Spring Boot, SQL, and
